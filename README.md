# Best Books API

This API is a simple web API where you make CRUD calls to a server to organize a book clubs app.

## Front-end Project Task Management Interface

You can use this API in conjunction with my front-end project management app [see the repo](https://github.com/christine-contreras/project-bestbooks-client)

## Technologies Used in API

- Ruby on Rails
- ActiveRecord
- PostgreSQL
- Bcrypt
- Active Model Serializers

## How To Use

Install it and run:

```sh
bundle install

# create migrations with activerecord
rails db:migrate

# if you would like to use seed data
rails db:seed

# start server
rails s
```

RoR uses port 3000 by default

## Relationships within Database

```rb
                                                          :deadline

description: "Most of us have no idea what’s really going on inside our heads. Yet brain scientists have uncovered details every business leader, parent, and teacher should know—like the need for physical activity to get your brain working its best.How do we learn? What exactly do sleep and stress do to our brains? Why is multi-tasking a myth? Why is it so easy to forget—and so important to repeat new knowledge? Is it true that men and women have different brains?In Brain Rules, Dr. John Medina, a molecular biologist, shares his lifelong interest in how the brain sciences might influence the way we teach our children and the way we work. In each chapter, he describes a brain rule—what scientists know for sure about how our brains work—and then offers transformative ideas for our daily lives.Medina’s fascinating stories and infectious sense of humor breathe life into brain science. You’ll learn why Michael Jordan was no good at baseball. You’ll peer over a surgeon’s shoulder as he proves that most of us have a Jennifer Aniston neuron. You’ll meet a boy who has an amazing memory for music but can’t tie his own shoes.You will discover how:Every brain is wired differentlyExercise improves cognitionWe are designed to never stop learning and exploringMemories are volatileSleep is powerfully linked with the ability to learnVision trumps all of the other sensesStress changes the way we learnIn the end, you’ll understand how your brain really works—and how to get the most out of it.",
